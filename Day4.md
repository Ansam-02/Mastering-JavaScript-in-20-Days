# What I learned from the fourth day tasks
## Example :
 > Use Multiple Conditional [Ternary] Operators
   It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line,
   here is my solution:
   ```javascript
     function checkSign(num) {
      return (num > 0) ? 'positive'
      : (num <0) ? 'negative'
      :'zero';
      }

   ```
