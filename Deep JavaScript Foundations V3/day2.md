# Day 2: Static Type and Scope
This file summarizes the JavaScript lesson on Static Type and Scope .These Consepts are important in programming, Statically-typed languages perform type checking at compiletime, while dynamically typed languages perform type checking at runtime. The scope is the current context of execution in which values and expressions are "visible" or can be referenced.
Example:

```javascript

```

## Lesson Summary

- Strict mode is generated automatically in js and it make a special behavior.
- Strict mode example:
  ```javascript
  const fun = () => {
    title = "Welcome"; // reference error
    console.log(title);
  };
  ```
- The code above reference an error deo to strict mode.
- Undefined: means that it's declared but it's dose not have any value.
- Declared: means that it's has never declared on the whole program.

## Coding Example

```javascript
  var teacher = "khaldoon"

  function otherClass(){
      vat teacher = "shadi"
      console.log("Welcome")
  }

  function ask(){
      var = question = "why?";
      console.log(question)
  }

  otherClass()
  ask()

```
