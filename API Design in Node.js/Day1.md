# API Basics in Node.js
API is about registering all of these unique URL combinations and then creating functions that respond to them. and Node.js uses JS as the language of choice. it's an enviroment to run javascript out of the browser. API It does do much functionally.

## notes for me:
- the port: virtual place on your computer's operating system. where network connections start and end (unique).
- IP address: unique location of where the server is located on the network. HTTP method as(GET ,POST ,PUT , PATCH, DELETE)
- Route handler: A route handler is a function that executes when a certain route is triggered from an incoming request.
- Express.js: is neat and highly adopted framework for Node.js that makes it trivial to build an API.

**Lets create an API with Express**
```node.js
  npm i express --save or yarn add express
```
